			<h2>About Us</h2>
				<p>I was introduced to the world of paper toys when my daughter and I were looking for something to do one rainy day a few years ago. I found the site for Readymech and we built three of the models, Skeletron, UK Johnny, and Tentaclopse. Then, I came across State of Shock Studios. They’ve done paper toy versions of Phish as well as Frank Zappa. That’s when it clicked for me, and I started to search for what else was out there. One link led to five more, and then five more, and so on. Each site/designer offered up their paper toys for free. I literally stayed awake all night clicking and clicking, downloading template after template. Very addictive.</p>

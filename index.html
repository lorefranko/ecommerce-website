<h1>Who knew?</h1>
<p>Apparently making paper toy monsters is kind of a big deal to a certain small group of art and design enthusiasts. And like street art, break dancing, wrestling, or any other niche art groove, there are heroes, villains, elaborate story lines, and great names (not just of the monsters but of the designers themselves). Oh, and no small amount of nerd factor. I basically knew nothing about this—is “movement” too strong of a word?—but apparently like any hobby, it can be extremely addictive, so let that be a warning.dwdwdwdwdwdwdwdwd</p>
